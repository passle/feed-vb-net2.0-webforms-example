Passle ASP.Net Webforms vb.net .net 2.0 feed example
==================

This solution is an example of how the Passle XML feed can be used in a 
ASP.NET webforms application when using vb.net .net 2.0. It was implemented 
in ASP.NET webforms, and created in Visual Studio 2012. To see the example feed, 
simply run the solution.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please note: 

  1. You'll need replace the shortcode in the view with the shortcode of the Passle you are trying to display
> You can get this from the settings page of your Passle.
  2. The feed depends on JQuery >= v1.8.3 (It may work with some earlier versions of JQuery)
  3. The container `div` for the feed must have a class of `passle-shortcode`
